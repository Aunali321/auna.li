		Following the shutdown of YT Vanced, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a group of
		individuals I had not previously worked with. We worked together to preserve the legacy of YT
		Vanced, resulting in the development of ReVanced - a powerful library that allows developers to
		add features to existing applications. To simplify the installation process for users, we also
		created an Android app. Today, ReVanced has a thriving community with over 100k+ subredditors,
		88k+ Discord members, 40k+ Telegram members, and 10k+ GitHub followers.
